							<p>
								I am User Experience designer with <strong>7 years of industry experience</strong> in Toronto. Currently, I work as a UX/Visual Designer 2 at <strong>Microsoft</strong> with an amazing team building features for the M365 office suite.  Outside of work, I am an avid video game player, a seasoned traveller, and an aspiring chef.

							<h4>Summary</h4>
							<h6>Intersection of design, business and marketing</h6>
								<p>
									Even though I have handled the end-to-end UX design process in past roles, my strength is in distilling research insights and creating designs that balance user needs, business requirements, and technical constraints. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I play the role of the user advocate on my teams by helping contextualize new feature ideas in user scenarios and task flows. I take extra steps to understand the problem before jumping into solving it.
								</p>

								<h4>Background story</h4>
							  <h6>Following my passion</h6>
							<p>Design has always been my passion and hobby since my early childhood. Although I studied Business Economics the traditional way at universities, I learned to design on my own out of curiosity.</p>
								<p>This curiosity helped me to stay up-to-date from year to year and I’m still learning every single day to ensure I can deliver the most modern and effective solutions. I believe in working hard and smart instead of searching for “hacks and shortcuts”.</p>
								<p> Nowadays, I’ve been fortunate enough to share and give back to the community with leading by example, writing detailed design articles, and sharing my design journey to educate and inspire others. </p>

								<h4>What I am looking for</h4><br/>Until now, I have only worked on small-scale early-stage products with less than 100 users. In most instances, I have been the first designer in the organization and have been responsible for setting up the design process. Because of the rapidly changing priorities in the teams and simultaneous development of multiple products, I have not been able to stay with one product for more than one release cycle.</p>
								<p>
								In the future, I am looking for a role where I get to work on a large-scale information system within a mature product team. I want to work on a product that has multiple user roles, a large number of use cases, and several interconnected workflows. I want to stay with the product as it evolves across multiple release cycles. I am looking for a collaborative team that has a culture of constructive feedback, building on ideas, learning from others, and continued growth. 
								</p>
								<p>My long-term vision is to grow into a design leader, and I can best gain those skills by being in a system where good practices are successfully in place. I want work in an organization which has established design processes and senior design leadership who I can learn from. </p>

							  <h4>Why Design?</h4>
							  <h6>Making people happy by making things simple</h6>
							  <p>As technology progresses things are getting more and more complex. As a designer, I have a special opportunity to make these complex processes simple, delightful and joy to use every day. </p>
							
							<p>
							  Design allows us to differentiate ourselves by showing attention and care about our customers and users. Everybody values design either consciously or unconsciously. This is why I love creating thoughtful, meaningful and polished experiences, which makes both the creators and customers happy.
